Next Tasks:
- baking game:
        - shape dough into balls and put in oven until full
            - can be faster with more chatters
        - fills oven with cookies
        - if oven is full, it automatically starts baking
    - take cookies out on time with command
        - anyone can do it
        - to late -> cookies are black 
        - to soon -> don't taste well
    - put into cookie jar, throw away, or put back to oven
    - cookies jars cookie need property to store if undercooked/overcooked(black)
    - cookie eating command needs to take out a random cookie
            
    - eat cooking (only possible if cookies left).
    - bake cookie (takes some effort)
        - mini game where the ingredients have to be put in?
        - baked cookies are for every chatter
- change to modules?
- outfits. Dogs can wear clothing. Store choices for chatters even when leaving

Big Idea:
- do some game for chatters.
    - chatter can play something while i do coding
    - chatter are "just" audiance and can emote somehow
        - think about simple options
        - command "throw ball"
    - chatter are a type of input for a game i build
        - idea: chatSim
            - each chatter becomes a citizen of a game world
                - moves mostly by itself but chatter can influence somethings
